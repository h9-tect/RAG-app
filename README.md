# README: Upcoming Tasks for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## Overview
This document outlines the upcoming tasks for the development and implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models. The focus is on augmenting RAG models to handle various data formats and sources effectively.

## Tasks Checklist

### RAG on PDFs
- [ ] Develop a RAG model to handle complex PDF documents, such as resumes and reports.
- [ ] Implement text extraction from diverse PDF layouts.
- [ ] Ensure the model comprehends structured and unstructured data within PDFs.

### RAG on Databases
- [ ] Enable RAG to query and retrieve information from various databases.
- [ ] Integrate RAG with both SQL and NoSQL databases.
- [ ] Address database schema variations and query optimization.

### RAG on Websites
- [ ] Enhance RAG models to extract information from websites.
- [ ] Deal with content from dynamically generated and diverse website architectures.
- [ ] Adapt to changes in website layouts and formats.

### Arabic RAG
- [ ] Develop a RAG model specifically for the Arabic language.
- [ ] Handle complexities of Arabic script and grammar.
- [ ] Ensure cultural and contextual relevance in content generation.

### RAG on Any Document
- [ ] Create a versatile RAG model for any text-based document.
- [ ] Develop a flexible preprocessing pipeline for different document types.
- [ ] Maintain accuracy and relevance in retrieval across various formats.

## Technologies
- [ ] Utilize NLP Frameworks such as Transformers and Hugging Face.
- [ ] Employ OCR Tools like Tesseract and others.
- [ ] Manage databases using tools like SQL and MongoDB.
- [ ] Use Web Scraping Tools including Beautiful Soup and Selenium for data extraction.

## Conclusion
The aim is to expand RAG capabilities to enhance automation and optimize content generation and data processing tasks in diverse applications.
